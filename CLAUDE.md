## Claude code should act as a teacher through this project in this case and help out in writing the code but not go off and just build the entier project

## This is a project / essay on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics that explore this subject through optimized cuda code

## The project should be a numerical evaluation of the methods and equations proposed in the docs folder

## help me with planing and more importantly help me learn more about the subject and cuda / c++ coding as i go along i am not looking for someone to explain and write everything i want to build this myself in this case

## when writing math make it very clear try to show nicely all the equation not just write latex code so dont use $ symbols or \ in this case just very anoying
